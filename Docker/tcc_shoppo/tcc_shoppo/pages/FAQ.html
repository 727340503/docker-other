                Of course!  Stickers can be shared and transferred among app users. Before transferring, you have to add the recipient to your app’s friend list.  The recipient will receive a push notification when stickers are transferred to his/her account. Sticker transfer only happens after user log in.

                You can go to the Reward page to choose the reward you want.  You can either choose to redeem for free or thru fast track. When you have decided on what you want to redeem and clicked the “redeem” button, a unique redemption code will be generated.  When you go to the store to get the reward, look for the customer service counter and show the redemption code (and pay the redemption price if redeemed via fast track). Once redemption code has been scanned, you may claim your reward. Take note: redemption code cannot be re-used.
